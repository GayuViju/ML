# Wine Quality Prediction

This project predicts the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset contains different features of wine, such as acidity, sugar, and chlorides, along with a quality score.

## Features Used
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- And more...

## Model
- Random Forest Classifier
- Trained to predict wine quality scores

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset.
2. Train the Random Forest model.
3. Predict the quality of new wine samples.
4. Interpret the results as "Safe" or "Unsafe" based on predicted quality.

## Results
- Accuracy: Around 85%
- Mean Squared Error: Around 0.145

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## How to Run
- Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script or google colab.
- Run the cells step-by-step.
- Use the prediction function to test new samples
